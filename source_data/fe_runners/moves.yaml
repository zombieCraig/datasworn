      __Session moves__ provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Fe-Runners sessions.
    description: |-
      The __session moves__ fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before, during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Fe-Runners sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and guided modes.

      Unlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.

          __When you begin a significant session or chapter of play__, do all of the following.

            * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](datasworn:move:fe_runners/session/set_a_flag).
            * Review or recap what happened last session.
            * Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

          In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

            * __Reframe:__ This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
            * __Refocus:__ This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
            * __Replace:__ This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
            * __Redirect:__ Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
            * __Reshape:__ The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

    description: |-
      In the fiction of the *Fe-Runners* setting, those who swear vows are the Ironsworn, and their promises are binding. Vows can be made to yourself, as a solemn representation of your personal commitment, or as a promise to someone else. Some vows might be made grudgingly—out of duty, necessity, or tradition. Others will be made with your whole heart.

          __When you forcibly need to disconnect from the network or a system__, envision the situation and how you are disconnecting.  If you are at a safe location you may simply disconnect without making a roll and  assume a __strong hit__.  If playing Fe-Runners as an extension of another game, transfer the health and spirit  values to your other character sheet. Ensure you advance any tension clocks while disconnected.

            * Being chased, evading: Roll +edge
            * Forced disconnect: Roll +iron
            * Covering tracks while disconnecting: Roll +shadow

          On a __strong hit__, you successfully disconnect as intended.  Next time you connect you will start at the Core segment.  You can retrace your steps back without having to [[Map Route]](datasworn:move:fe_runners/exploration/map_route) or [[Infiltrate Segment]](datasworn:move:fe_runners/exploration/infiltrate_segment).  If this was a system, you can attempt to [[Gain Entry]](datasworn:move:fe_runners/exploration/gain_entry) at a later time with a +1 to the roll.

          On a __weak hit__, You manage to disconnect but your route is burned, mapping progress and relay nodes have been compromised and can not be used again.  You will need to use [[Map Route]](datasworn:move:fe_runners/exploration/map_route) and [[Infiltrate Segment]](datasworn:move:fe_runners/exploration/infiltrate_segment) again.

          On a __miss__, You disconnect it the worst way.  Envision what happens and apply the appropriate Suffer Move.  On a match, [[Endure Harm]](datasworn:move:fe_runners/suffer/endure_harm) (-2).
