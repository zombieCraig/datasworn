    summary: |-
      The Sentient AI is a bit of chaos that can show itself just about anywhere and at any time.  This is an 
      optional piece you can include into your gameplay.  It works in a similar fashion to that of the Cursed Die 
      in Ironsworn - Sundered Isles.  In which you use an additional die to represent the Sentient AI.  If the die 
      roll is a 10 then the AI reveals itself and often introduces a bit of unpredictability into the story before 
      quickly vanishing again.
