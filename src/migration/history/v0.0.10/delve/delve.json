They are abstract word prompts you can interpret as appropriate to the current situation and setting. For example, you are traveling through a [Wild](id:delve/site_themes/wild) [Tanglewood](id:delve/site_domains/tanglewood) and roll “Something unusual or unexpected” on the domain feature table. You then [Ask the Oracle](id:classic/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle) what you discover using the [Aspect](id:delve/oracles/feature/aspect) and [Focus](id:delve/oracles/feature/focus) tables. The oracle responds, “Depleted Environment.” Interpreting this answer, you envision coming upon an expanse of cleared forest. All that remains of this once thick woodland is rotted stumps. What happened here? Perhaps the answer lies ahead...",

Then, roll up to four times for [Characteristics](id:delve/oracles/monstrosity/characteristics) and keep up to three of those results. Do the same for [Abilities](id:delve/oracles/monstrosity/abilities).\n\nGive the monstrosity a rank. Choose one appropriate to its features, or use the [Challenge Rank](id:classic/oracles/turning_point/challenge_rank) oracle.\n\nFinally, envision your creation and give it a name. It’s part of your world now.\n\nSome results on these tables include two related options separated by a slash (/). Pick the one which best fits the nature of the creature or is the most interesting. You can also make one of the options likely, and [Ask the Oracle](id:classic/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle) (using the pick two procedure) to confirm your choice. Or just take both!\n\nYou should weave these abilities into the fiction of your encounter with a monstrosity. Combined with its physical characteristics, they help define the creature’s approach and tactics. Make moves as appropriate to overcome, avoid, or face the consequences of these abilities.\n\nTo learn more about your creation’s nature, you can roll on additional tables. Use the [Character Goal](id:classic/oracles/character/goal) oracle to give the monstrosity a purpose. Roll on the [Character Disposition](id:classic/oracles/character/disposition) and [Activity](id:delve/oracles/character/activity) oracles to frame your initial encounter. Another roll or two can give your monstrosity nuance and complexity, making it a deeper part of your story.",

Then, fill in the blanks by using the [Description](id:delve/oracles/site_name/description), [Detail](id:delve/oracles/site_name/detail), [Namesake](id:delve/oracles/site_name/namesake), and [Place](id:delve/oracles/site_name/place) oracles.\n\nIf the form of a particular word doesn’t work, try making it plural instead of singular, or vice-versa.\n\nIf you already know the theme and domain, you can pick from the tables instead of rolling. If not, you can use these oracles to help define those aspects of the site. Use the [Place](id:delve/oracles/site_name/place) oracle to roll for a domain, and let the [Description](id:delve/oracles/site_name/description) and [Detail](id:delve/oracles/site_name/detail) oracles inform your selection of a theme.\n\nThe site’s name might be known in your world, or it could just be an evocative label you use to understand its history and nature.\n\nEven without giving a site a name, you can use the [Description](id:delve/oracles/site_name/description) and [Detail](id:delve/oracles/site_name/detail) oracles to help flesh out the theme and nature of that place.\n\nFor example, you hear rumors about a nearby ruin while visiting a settlement. What do you learn? You [Ask the Oracle](id:classic/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle), using the [Description](id:delve/oracles/site_name/description) and [Detail](id:delve/oracles/site_name/detail) tables. The oracle responds, “Bloodied Banishment.”\n\nInterpreting these keywords, you envision this settlement’s grim method of enacting justice. Anyone sentenced to death for a crime is taken to the ruins. There, under the fading light of the setting sun, they are bloodied by the quick slash of a ceremonial blade. Finally, they are chained to an altar within the central courtyard. The foul creatures who dwell in that place do the rest.",

			"description": "These oracles support the optional threat mechanics detailed in Chapter 6.\n\nYou can use the [Category](id:delve/oracles/threat/category) oracle above to randomly select a broad type of threat for your campaign. If you are told to roll twice, take both results and decide how these two threats act together or represent a more complex situation. For example, choosing both a [Malignant Plague](id:delve/oracles/threat/malignant_plague) and [Zealous Cult](id:delve/oracles/threat/zealous_cult) might signify an evil sect which has unleashed a sickness upon the Ironlands in service to some dark god.\n\nFor additional detail, use other oracles as appropriate. For example, you can look to the [Action](id:classic/oracles/action_and_theme/action) and [Theme](id:classic/oracles/action_and_theme/theme) oracles (Ironsworn Core, page 174) or [Character Goal](id:classic/oracles/character/goal) oracle (Ironsworn Core, page 182) to define the motivations of a [Scheming Leader](id:delve/oracles/threat/scheming_leader).\n\nOnce you’ve introduced a threat, consider how it endangers something or someone important to you, and [Swear an Iron Vow](id:classic/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to see its goal undone.\n\nThen, as you [Advance a Threat](id:delve/moves/threat/advance_a_threat), you can roll on the oracle table for your specific threat to generate an action, approach, or complication. Interpret the oracle’s answer as appropriate to the nature of the threat and the current situation.\n\nIf you aren’t using the threat mechanics within your campaign, you can use still these oracles to inspire details for enemies, troubles, and complications.",

When you use the whetstone, you may hear distant echoes of long-ago battles; when you carry it, you bear the legacy of those brave champions.",

This will guide me back home. Back to you.”\n\nBut his ship did not return. Weeks passed. Then months. All hope seemed lost. One night, as the mourning husband held the string tight in a closed fist, there came a knock at the door. It was the sailor, with no memory of what brought him there.\n\nCenturies later, these twin strings—passed into legend and now returned—are held in a simple wooden box. When you carry it, you are reminded of the importance of a place and the people there, and it helps set you on the path home.",

Ancient tone steps lead from the shore into a grand doorway in the side of the rock face.\n\nBeyond the doorway, vast passages and chambers are carved through the center of Hollowmount Island. This underkeep, undiscovered until recently, preserves the secrets and history of a long-forgotten people.\n\nLast year, a band of raiders took up residence within the outer halls of the underkeep.

Who else, other than their own leader—a skilled sailor they call Kayu the Bold—is foolish enough to make landfall here? But they have neglected to consider the dangers that may lie within.

As the creature fell, disintegrating into ash, it sowed the land with its primal fire. Now, the trees smolder with spectral flame, giving off a choking heat and noxious smoke. The creatures of this place are driven to madness by this perpetual, ghostly blaze, and a tribe of Varou seek vengeance for what was destroyed.\n\nMystics speak of visions of the primordial’s heart at the center of the wood. Will removing this heart cure the forest of its curse of flame?",

There, he discovered the stones scattered in shallow waters and buried in mud near the shore—all that was left of the ancient place which haunted his dreams. Piece by piece, he recovered the remains of the fortress, transplanting the stones laboriously to an island at the lake’s center.\n\nMost laughed at this crazy venture. But some joined Kord, drawn to this place by a compulsion they can’t understand or explain. Guided by the stonewright’s unwavering vision, they rebuilt the vaults of the fortress and its tall central spire. Today, nearly two decades later, the workforce numbers in the hundreds. They live in ramshackle camps encircling the fortress and on the lakeshore. Many protect the place with spear and shield. The stones sing to them, they say, and with each block mortared in place the words become clearer. Folk of this area call them the builders.\n\nThe strange tower, nearly complete, now looms over the valley. There’s a hum in the air, an expectant energy like the lull before a great storm. What is about to happen?",

There is a stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.",
